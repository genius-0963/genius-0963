# IIITIAN-SAURABH
# 💫 Welcome to my Github profile! 👋  

I’m **Saurabh Kumar**, an open-source contributor and software developer passionate about building impactful projects. 🚀  
Currently pursuing **Electronics and Communication Engineering** at **IIIT Allahabad**, I enjoy contributing to developer tools, experimenting with Web/App Development, and exploring AI, Data Science, and Cyber Security.  

I actively contribute to open-source projects like **Firecrawl** and **Google DeepMind repos (VideoPrism, tf2jax)**, where I focus on improving stability, developer ergonomics, and feature enhancements. 🌍  
Beyond contributions, I love working on innovative projects—from real-time AI applications to full-stack systems—that bridge ideas with practical solutions. 📱
